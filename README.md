thanks again for the nice chat a few minutes ago. As promised, here is the challenge we'd like you to solve prior to an interview with Hans (our head of development).

https://innosabi.com/download/innosabi-assignment-fullstack.zip

 

If you want to solve the challenge as a Full Stack challenge, just solve it as given.

 

A Short sidenote if you want to solve it as a Backend challenge:

The staging URLs aren’t accessible externally. Still, please consider the different programming environments in your implementation. 

Also, you only have to work on the following tasks: Slider, Highlighting and Proxy.

You can solve the Highlighting task completely in PHP. The criteria of the assignment remain the same, you just have to use PHP instead of JS.

Use PHP for the Rendering of the Slider and keep on using the JS Plugin like recommended in the task (e.g. of Bootstrap).


 

This shouldn’t take longer than 3-4 hours. Please try to send us the results until the end of next week/the beginning of the week after that. If that won’t be possible for you, please write me an email. Once you are finished, please send Hans, Erika and me your finished code in a ZIP file via email. If you have questions about the challenge, feel free to send Hans an email.

We look forward to your code :)
